            <p>After the interview with Tracy, I know what type of games that 4th graders usually play in class (e.g. UNO, Monopoly, Game Trouble).
            Besides, I learn about the History learning program distributed to 4th graders, and what devices and tools are used during the lectures based on the subjects.
            Moreover, the size of class matters to our project, and I know that there are around 30-35 students per class.
            Eggpuzzle is a popular app used in 4th grade as it can take a video, pause, and check understanding by asking questions or giving thoughts.
            It offers a public library where people can contribute on question set or so.
            </p>
            <p>List of questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>So to get started, could you provide us with a little bit of background of yourself?</li>
                <li>Have you taught other grades besides 4th graders? If you have, how are they different?</li>
                <li>(if only 4th grade) What do you find most interesting about 4th graders?</li>
                <li>What media or platforms do you find most helpful when educating 4th graders?</li>
                <li>What subject area do you find the most difficult to teach, and why?</li>
                <li>What types of activities do 4th graders prefer during school time?</li>
                <li>Have you ever taught a subject material through a game platform?</li>
                <li>(What is the most difficult part when you try to teach with games?)</li>
            </ul>

                    Tracy: 4th grade teacher: Since our project is for 4th graders and considered as an academic tool, Tracy has
                    experience of how academic applications become helpful and how they should look like.
