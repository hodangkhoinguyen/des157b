                    <li>The status of the game should display on the main screen right away. Also, for now, we don't have the final result page yet.</li>

                    <li>Jennifer will work on re-design the colors for the game. She also plan to add some typical images of Davis around the board.</li>
                    <li>Jennifer also will make more questions. She also wants to have more styling for the board game (such as color, ribbons, Davis images).</li>
                    <li>I will continue work on the game flow with more questions added.</li>
                    <li>I also work on the final result page and status for each turn.</li>
