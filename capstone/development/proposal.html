                <p>My topic is about places of interests in Davis. The target audience includes adults who love biking.
                    The website can have multiple challenge sets such as 10-15-20 miles that is the total distance they can bike after
                    visint a certain number of interests. Also, they can upload their check-in photos to the website, and newcomers can view them.
                    On the other hand, the website can randomly pick some places of interests that users want to visit if they don't know where to go and need some reference.
                </p>
                <p>I'd like to work with a partner to complete the project as beautiful and practical as possible. But I need to reach out to a couple of classmates first.
                    I'm quite limited on designing, so I hope my partner can help me with that aspect. Also, there might be some challenges about how to pick the places out of many options
                    for users, like what algorithm should I use? I'm also thinking of adding a rate feature for each place, then it's easier to sort them by rating although this approach
                    might be bias.
