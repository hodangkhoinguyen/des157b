                    has a simple basic design. Most of the routes are pre-created and linked to pdf files. The interaction is very limited and we cannot really see all details on the pdf map.
                    It seems for student user, so I feel the design straightforward for their experience.

                        has a more dynamic design as they provide a lot of different challenges. It displays different interesting things beside the main problem set (daily challenge, categories, etc).
                        Users can pick on their own or there's a random button. It's very user-friendly.
