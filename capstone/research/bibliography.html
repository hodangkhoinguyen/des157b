                <h3>Shelton, Suan. "The Davis Centennial Seal." <i>Susan Shelton Ceramic Artist</i>, https://susanshelton.com/Seals/Davis-Centennial-Seal. Accessed 9 May 2023.</h3>
                <p>
                    Susan Shelton made this web page to introduce about the Davis Centennial Seal which was designed by her. This seal becomes iconic for Davis City because of honoring and highlighting several historic figures and events. On this webpage, Shelton described her overall design and every major fragments of the seal including the central image, the rings, and the ten panels around the seal. One of the panels is about the Innovative Contributions of Citizens which has a picture about biking in Davis. This aspect is very typical in Davis, and this is the topic that I want to do for the capstone project.

                <h3>Davis Historic Pedestrian And Bike Tour. <i>City of Davis, CA</i>, https://www.cityofdavis.org/about-davis/history-symbols/davis-historic-pedestrian-and-bike-tour. Accessed 9 May 2023.</h3>
                <p>The article shows many suggestions about typical facilities that pedestrians and bikers can refer for their tour. These locations have different historical stories related to the development of Davis City. This can help visitors who want to experience biking in Davis â€“ a biking city, with many options to explore the city and do some exercises at the same time. They may not be able to visit all locations, but they can do it at their own pace with their preferences. I will consider these locations when developing my websites for the final project.

                <p>
                    The article introduces a program that encourages Davis students to bike and walk to and from school to help the environment. This program can benefit students both physically and mentally because of highly physical activities. Also, it helps reduce Carbone Dioxide gas and money. On top of that, I can use this program as a reference when doing my own project. Visitors are encouraged by my website to participate in biking while exploring Davis. Instead of commuting to school like Active4me, my website suggests multiple locations for newcomers to visit and see the history of Davis City.
